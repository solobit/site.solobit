Ever started a book only to put it away after 5 minutes? Or actually finish it
but without a clue how you got there, flabbergasted...

I had to read a lot of books in school and more than half, we never really 'got'
them. Sure, if you knew where to look, the meaning of the author was rather
clear but no teacher who ever told us to interpret the cow as his mother.

You know, I found software to share many of the properties with those authors.
You have to be initiated to understand what they ment to achieve, an architect
to understand the why and how.

That is what Coffeebook does....
