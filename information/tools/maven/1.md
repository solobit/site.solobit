# Maven and Clojure

Clojure's support in Maven is provided by clojure-maven-plugin, that is available in Maven's central repository, so it always available1. As a base for your projects you can use pom.xml file from clojure-maven-example project.

If you already have pom.xml in your project, then to enable this plugin, you will need to add following code into <plugins> section of pom.xml:

```xml
  <plugin>
    <groupId>com.theoryinpractise</groupId>
    <artifactId>clojure-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.10</version>
  </plugin>
```


```sh
 mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DgroupId=com.solobit.cljnode -DartifactId=clojurenode
```

The vast majority of Maven-built projects can be built with the following command:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

Maven can do more than just build software - it can assist with testing, run web applications and produce reports on projects, as well as any number of other tasks provided by [plug-ins][01]. Make sure to [read the guide][02] to configuring plugins.
