# autoquit - Automatically quit node.js servers when inactive.

  Detects when a server has been inactive for a period of time and shuts it down.
  
  Designed to be used in combination with something like node-systemd: https://github.com/rubenv/node-systemd

  Developed by Flow Pilots: http://www.flowpilots.com/

## Usage
  
  You can install the latest version via npm:
  
    $ npm install autoquit

  Require the autoquit module. It will monkey-patch the support for auto-quitting into net.Server.

    require('autoquit');

  Create an app as usual and call the `autoQuit` method. Do this before calling `listen` to avoid inconsistencies in the connection counting.

    var http = require('http');
    var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
        res.end('Hello World\n');
    });
    server.autoQuit();
    server.listen(1337);
  
  Do a request to your service:

    # curl -i http://localhost:1337/
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/plain
    Connection: keep-alive
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    
    Hello World

  After 10 minutes of inactivity (the default), it will close the server.

## Specifying options

  Autoquit currently has one option: specifying the idle timeout. You can pass options as an object to the `autoQuit` call:
  
    server.autoQuit({ timeOut: 900 });
    
  Accepted options:
  
  * `timeOut`: number of seconds of inactivity before triggering the shutdown method.
