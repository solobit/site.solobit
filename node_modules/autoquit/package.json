  "readme": "# autoquit - Automatically quit node.js servers when inactive.\n\n  Detects when a server has been inactive for a period of time and shuts it down.\n  \n  Designed to be used in combination with something like node-systemd: https://github.com/rubenv/node-systemd\n\n  Developed by Flow Pilots: http://www.flowpilots.com/\n\n## Usage\n  \n  You can install the latest version via npm:\n  \n    $ npm install autoquit\n\n  Require the autoquit module. It will monkey-patch the support for auto-quitting into net.Server.\n\n    require('autoquit');\n\n  Create an app as usual and call the `autoQuit` method. Do this before calling `listen` to avoid inconsistencies in the connection counting.\n\n    var http = require('http');\n    var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {\n        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n        res.end('Hello World\\n');\n    });\n    server.autoQuit();\n    server.listen(1337);\n  \n  Do a request to your service:\n\n    # curl -i http://localhost:1337/\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Content-Type: text/plain\n    Connection: keep-alive\n    Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n    \n    Hello World\n\n  After 10 minutes of inactivity (the default), it will close the server.\n\n## Specifying options\n\n  Autoquit currently has one option: specifying the idle timeout. You can pass options as an object to the `autoQuit` call:\n  \n    server.autoQuit({ timeOut: 900 });\n    \n  Accepted options:\n  \n  * `timeOut`: number of seconds of inactivity before triggering the shutdown method.    \n    \n## License \n\n    (The MIT License)\n\n    Copyright (C) 2011-2012 by Ruben Vermeersch <ruben@savanne.be>\n\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
